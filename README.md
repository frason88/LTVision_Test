# What is LTVision?
--------------------

LTVision is an open-source library from Meta, designed to empower businesses to unlock the full potential of predicted customer lifetime value (pLTV) modeling.

Our vision is to lead the industry by building a community of pLTV practitioners that drives innovation and creates value for everyone in the pLTV ecosystem through expertise, education, and thought leadership.

Our first release - Module 1, is now available. It focuses on generating customer insights and estimating the potential pLTV opportunity size, enabling business decision-makers to evaluate the potential ROI of this initiative before investing in a pLTV model and pLTV strategy.

LTVision is the first step on the pLTV journey. To learn more about Metaâ€™s thought leadership on pLTV, please download our [whitepaper](https://github.com/facebookincubator/LTVision/raw/refs/heads/main/Predicting-LTV-Whitepaper.pdf#).
